# RFM Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates a customer segmentation approach using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. RFM analysis is a marketing tool that allows businesses to segment their customers based on purchasing behavior, helping identify high-value customers, churn risks, and potential growth opportunities.

The analysis is based on a retail dataset, and the goal is to segment customers into meaningful groups for targeted marketing and engagement strategies. This project includes all the steps required to calculate RFM scores, assign customer segments, and provide recommendations for each group.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes the following fields:
- `customer_id`: A unique identifier for each customer.
- `trans_date`: The date of each transaction.
- `tran_amount`: The amount spent in each transaction.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Load and preprocess the dataset.
    - Ensure that the transaction date (`trans_date`) is properly formatted for time-based calculations.
    
2. **RFM Metrics Calculation**:
    - **Recency**: Calculate how recently a customer made their last purchase.
    - **Frequency**: Count the total number of purchases made by each customer.
    - **Monetary**: Sum the total amount spent by each customer.

3. **RFM Scoring**:
    - Assign scores (1-5) to each customer for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary based on quintiles.
    - Combine the scores to create an overall RFM score for each customer.

4. **RFM Segmentation**:
    - Segment customers into groups based on their RFM scores, using a predefined mapping.
    - Customer segments include categories like `Champions`, `At Risk`, `Hibernating`, and more.

5. **Recommendations**:
    - Provide marketing and engagement strategies tailored to each customer segment.
    - Identify opportunities for customer retention, re-engagement, and loyalty programs.
  
## Conclusion

This project provides an efficient way to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using RFM analysis. The insights gained from this analysis can help businesses make data-driven marketing decisions, enhance customer retention, and improve overall business performance.
